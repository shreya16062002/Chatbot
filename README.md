AI Chatbot using Python, Tkinter & Groq API

This project is a simple AI-powered chatbot built using Python, Tkinter, and the Groq LLaMA model.
It provides a clean graphical interface where users can send messages and receive AI-generated responses in real time.

🔹 Features

Chat-style GUI using Tkinter

Scrollable chat window with user & bot message bubbles

Real-time responses using Groq’s LLaMA 3.1 model

Press Enter or click Send to chat

Smooth auto-scrolling and clean message formatting

🔹 How It Works

The program connects to Groq’s AI using an API key.

When the user types a message, it is sent to the model through the API.

The AI response is extracted and displayed in a styled bubble format in the chat window.

Tkinter handles the full UI—windows, input box, buttons, and message display.
